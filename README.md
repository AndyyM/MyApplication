# MyApplication
Application with multiple functions including currency converter and options to view websites.
After I have done a few different things I will probably split them up into different applications for easier access.

**Simple Currency Converter**

Simple converter using fixer.io API.
Spinners used to choose between different currencies. 
Write in empty text field a value to convert.
